    where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to
    the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if
    any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft

    � updates,
    � supplements,
    � Internet-based services, and
    � support services

    for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.

    BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT
    USE THE SOFTWARE.

    IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE PERPETUAL RIGHTS BELOW.

    1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
      a. Installation and Use. You may install and use any number of copies of the
         software to design, develop and test your programs.
      b. Third Party Programs. The software may include third party programs that
         Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement.
         Notices, if any, for the third party program are included for your
         information only.

    2. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
      a. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  The software is comprised of Distributable Code.
         �Distributable Code� is code that you are permitted to distribute in
         programs you develop if you comply with the terms below.

            � You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.
            � Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs
              to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.
        ii. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute,
            you must
            � add significant primary functionality to it in your programs;
            � require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that
              protect it at least as much as this agreement;
            � display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and
            � indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,

              programs; or
            � modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so
              that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An
              Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use,
              modification or distribution, that
                � the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or

           Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and
           applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws
           principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other
           claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair
           competition laws, and in tort.

        b. Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other
           country, the laws of that country apply.

    10. LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have
        other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with
        respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement
        does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of
        your country do not permit it to do so.

    11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED �AS-IS.� YOU BEAR THE RISK
        OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR
        CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES
        UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT
        PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
        OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

        FOR AUSTRALIA - YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER
        LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.

    12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM
        MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU
        CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS,
        SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. This limitation applies to

        � anything related to the software, services, content (including code)
          on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
        � claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or
          condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent
          permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
    possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
    you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of
    incidental, consequential or other damages.

    clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.

    contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les
    garanties implicites de qualit� marchande, d�ad�quation � un usage particulier

    l��ventualit� d�un tel dommage. Si votre pays n�autorise pas l�exclusion ou la
    limitation de responsabilit� pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de
    quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l�exclusion
    ci-dessus ne s�appliquera pas � votre �gard.

    pourriez avoir d�autres droits pr�vus par les lois de votre pays. Le pr�sent
    contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous conf�rent les lois de votre pays si
