# Microsoft .NET Libraries

The license below applies to Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk and to packages which self-identify as following the MS-.NET-Library License

    MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS

    MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY

    These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation
    (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates). They apply to the
    software named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or
    updates for the software, except to the extent those have different terms.

    IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.

    1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
       You may install and use any number of copies of the software to develop
       and test your applications.

    2. THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS. The software may include third party components
       with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be
       described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.

    3. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.
       a. DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  The software is comprised of Distributable Code.
          “Distributable Code” is code that you are permitted to distribute in
          applications you develop if you comply with the terms below.

          i. Right to Use and Distribute.
             · You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.
             · Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your
               applications to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as
               part of those applications.

          ii. Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you
              distribute, you must
             · use the Distributable Code in your applications and not as a
               standalone distribution;
             · require distributors and external end users to agree to terms
               that protect it at least as much as this agreement; and
             · indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims,
               including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of
               your applications, except to the extent that any claim is based
               solely on the unmodified Distributable Code.

          iii. Distribution Restrictions. You may not
             · use Microsoft’s trademarks in your applications’ names or in a
               way that suggests your applications come from or are endorsed by
               Microsoft; or
             · modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so
               that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An
               “Excluded License” is one that requires, as a condition of use,
               modification or distribution of code, that (i) it be disclosed or
               distributed in source code form; or (ii) others have the right to
               modify it.

    4. DATA.
       a. Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and
          your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may
          use this information to provide services and improve our products and
          services.  You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as
          described in the software documentation.  There are also some features
          in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from
          users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply
          with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users
          of your applications together with Microsoft’s privacy statement. Our
          privacy statement is located at
          https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more
          about data collection and its use from the software documentation and
          our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your
          consent to these practices.

       b. Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or
          subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software,
          Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data
          Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all
          customers effective May 25, 2018, at
          https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr.

    5. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only
       gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other
       rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this
       limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this
       agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in
       the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not
       · work around any technical limitations in the software;
       · reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise
         attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the
         extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain
         open source components that may be included in the software;
       · remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its
         suppliers in the software;
       · use the software in any way that is against the law; or
       · share, publish, rent or lease the software, provide the software as a
         stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or
         this agreement to any third party.

    6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international
       export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include
       restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further
       information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.

    7. SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide
       support services for it.

    8. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates,
       Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire
       agreement for the software and support services.

    9. APPLICABLE LAW.  If you acquired the software in the United States,
       Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this
       agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other
       claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.

    10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain
        legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights,
        under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your
        relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to
        the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not
        change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not
        permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of
        the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following
        provisions apply to you:

       a) Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer
          Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.

       b) Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop
          receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature,
          disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you
          re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking
          for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product
          documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for
          your specific device or software.

       c) Germany and Austria.

          (i) Warranty. The software will perform substantially as described in
          any Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives no
          contractual guarantee in relation to the software.

          (ii) Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross
          negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as in
          case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable
          according to the statutory law.

        Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for
        slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual
        obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of
        this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this
        agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in
        (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence,
        Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence

    11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE
        RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR
        CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT
        EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

    12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER
        FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00.
        YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST
        PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

        This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software,
        services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or
        third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach
        of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or
        other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

        It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
        possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not
        apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion
        or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
