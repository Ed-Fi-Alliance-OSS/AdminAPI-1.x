## Development Pre-Requisites

- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
- Suggested to have either:
  - [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads), or
  - [Visual Studio 2022 Build
    Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)
    (install the ".NET Build Tools" component)
- Clone [this
  repository](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-ODS-AdminApi) locally
- To work with the official Ed-Fi Docker solution, also clone the [Docker
  repository](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-ODS-Docker).

## Build Script

The PowerShell script `build.ps1` in the root directory contains functions for
running standard build operations at the command line . This script assumes that
.NET 6.0 SDK or newer is installed. Other dependencies tools are downloaded
as needed (nuget, nunit).

Available command (e.g. `./build.ps1 clean`) (commands are not case sensitive):

- `clean`: runs `dotnet clean`
- `build`: runs `dotnet build` with several implicit steps
    (clean, restore, inject version information).
- `unitTest`: executes NUnit tests in projects named `*.UnitTests`, which
    do not connect to a database.
- `integrationTest`: executes NUnit tests in projects named `*.Test`,
    which connect to a database. Includes drop and deploy operations for
    installing fresh test databases compatible with Ed-Fi ODS/API 3.4 and 5.3.
- `buildAndTest`: executes the Build, UnitTest, and IntegrationTest
    commands.
- `package`: builds pre-release and release NuGet packages for the Admin
    App web application.
- `push`: uploads a NuGet package to the NuGet feed.
- `buildAndDeployToAdminApiDockerContainer`: runs the build operation, update
    the `appsettings.json` with provided Docker environment variables and copy
    over the latest files to existing AdminApi docker container for testing.
- `run`: runs the Admin API

Note: use the `IsLocalBuild` switch to install NuGet.exe if you do not already
have it in your local path.

Review the parameters at the top of `build.ps1` for additional command line
arguments.

## Running on Localhost

There are three ways of running Admin API:

- `build.ps1 run` to run from the command line.
- Run inside a container with the help of
  [compose-build-dev.yml](../Docker/Compose/pgsql/compose-build-dev.yml).
- Start from Visual Studio to take advantage of easy debugging integration.

There are several launch profiles available either with `build.ps1` or when
running from Visual Studio. Review
[launchSettings](../Application/EdFi.Ods.AdminApi/Properties/launchSettings.json)
for more information. Note that you should use the "Prod" launch setting when
running the Postman-based E2E tests.

### Configuring Admin API to Run with the ODS/API

Some features of the Admin API require interaction with the ODS/API. For that
reason, you may need to launch an instance of the ODS/API. The
`compose-build-dev.yml` file handles this for you.

With the other two options, you will need to startup the [ODS/API on your
own]((https://techdocs.ed-fi.org/display/ETKB/Ed-Fi+Operational+Data+Store+and+API)),
using Visual Studio or the command line. Do not start the ODS/API in a separate
Docker network from Admin API, because at present both need to access the same
`EdFi_Admin` and `EdFi_Security` databases. If starting up manually, make sure
that both Admin API and ODS/API have the same deployment setting:

- `sharedinstance`
- `yearspecific`
- `districtspecific`

In Admin API, you set this value in the `appsettings.json` file under
`AppSettings.ApiStartupType`. In the ODS/API, you set it as the
`ApiSettings.Mode` in the `appsettings.json` (ODS/API 5.x and 6.x) or in
`web.config` (ODS/API 3.x). Please see ODS/API documentation for more
information about the differences between these startup modes.

Admin API has a small set of database tables for internal management, which need
to be installed into the `EdFi_Admin` database. The SQL scripts for this are
under the [Artifacts](../Application/EdFi.Ods.AdminApi/Artifacts/) directory.
They can be installed from PowerShell with the following command:

```powershell
# From AdminApi clone directory
cd eng

# Accepting the default options: MSSQL, on localhost, using integrated security, using EdFi_Admin
./run-dbup-migrations.ps1

# Alternately, override all available settings
$config = @{
    "engine" = "PostgreSQL"
    "databaseServer" = "alternate-hostname"
    "databasePort" = "5466"
    "databaseUser" = "postgres"
    "databasePassword" = "a-strong-password"
    "useIntegratedSecurity" = $false
    "adminDatabaseName" = "EdFi_Admin_543"
}
./run-dbup-migrations.ps1 $config
```

### Resetting the Database State

If you need to reset your databases to a clean slate, run appropriate PowerShell
commands in the `Ed-Fi-ODS-Implementation` repository.

```powershell
pushd ../Ed-Fi-ODS-Implementation

# Checkout the ODS/API version you need to test with, for example v6.1, v5.3, v5.2, v5.1.1
git checkout v6.1

# Load PowerShell functions
./Initialize-PowershellForDevelopment.ps1

# Wipe out and re-install both databases
Reset-AdminDatabase
Reset-SecurityDatabase

# Wipe out and re-install the databases used by the DB integration tests
Reset-TestAdminDatabase
Reset-TestSecurityDatabase

# Re-run the Admin API migration scripts
popd

eng/run-dbup-migrations.ps1
```

### Running Locally in Docker

As mentioned above, you can run locally in Docker. See [docker.md](docker.md)
for more information.

## Testing Admin API

In source code there are two test projects:

- Unit tests that are completely isolated.
- The DB Tests project is a set of _integration_ tests that exercise the
  repository layer.

Additionally there is a set of end-to-end (E2E) tests in Postman. See the [E2E
Tests/README.md](../Application/EdFi.Ods.AdminApi/E2E%20Tests/README.md) for
more information on these tests.

All three of these test suites should be 100% green before merging new code into
the `main` branch.

## Application Architecture

The Admin API source code uses ASP.NET but it does not follow the traditional
ASP.NET model-view-controller (MVC) approach. Instead it relies on defining
Features and then automating the API routing to those features. Conceptually,
each Feature _is_ a Controller, though it does not inherit from the .NET
`Controller` class.

Each Feature implements the `IFeature` interface, which has a single function.
That function enables the feature to define its own HTTP endpoint route. The
Feature then has `Handle` function the contains the normal controller logic. Its
arguments are automatically interpreted and handled by the ASP.NET Core
dependency injection framework.

### Database Layer

Database interaction is mediated through [Entity Framework
Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) with two interfaces:
`IUsersContext` handles the `EdFi_Admin` database and `ISecurityContext` handles
the `EdFi_Security` database. The name "IUsersContext" derives from the admin
database being used to hold Admin App users and now Admin API client
credentials.

### Validation

Validation of API requests is configured via
[FluentValidation](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/).
