## Description
User Story
----------


As a system administrator, I want to run the Admin API 1\.x solution using MSSQL instead of PostgreSQL, with no prior knowledge about on\-premises deployments. Main use case is E2E testing.


Acceptance Criteria
-------------------


* MSSQL containers added to core images and/or docker demonstration (either the docker images published with sql Express or just the Docker File included with sql server without image publishing)
