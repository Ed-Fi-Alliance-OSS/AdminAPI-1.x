# ADMINAPI-742 - There is no way to set Applications.OdsInstance_OdsInstanceId via the API in Admin API 1.3

**Type**: Bug

**Status**: Done

## Description
Story
-----


As an Ed\-Fi implementer, I would like Admin API 1\.3 to allow population of Applications.OdsInstance\_OdsInstanceId.  There is no way to do this via the API today and this is requested for District\-Specific mode.


Details
-------


* This issue is reported by [Mark TenHoor](https://edfi.atlassian.net/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?accountId=5b9001de7c582d2b86e258dd) and team via their internal testing.  There isn't yet an active case for a request in this.


Acceptance Criteria
-------------------


* Update Admin API 1\.3\.x to include capability for setting to Applications.OdsInstance\_OdsInstanceId with an eye to enable school\-level selection in DistrictYearSpecific mode.
